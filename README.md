# hello-world

I am a hardworking, driven, trilingual (English, Chinese) senior Talent Acquisition professional, possessing full life cycle recruiting experience (agency and in-house). I have recruited across industries including retail, hospitality and my favourite being within the Tech space. 

I came across the vacancy you currently have for XXX and would love to be considered for this.

I’ve attached by CV in support of my application, but wanted to outline some of my experience to date in addition to some key reasons I think I’d be perfect for this opportunity.

I have over 8 years experience in international recruitment. I’ve built a 360 cycle of recruiting skills, working across all departments across functions including Corporate, operations and tech, for London, Europe and APAC.

What i love about Talent is recruiting for future ambassadors who are passionate in doing what they love and ultimately support the growth of the business.

After working for over a decade, I have gained excellent skills, knowledge and experience within this role. To re-change and refresh some personal skill set and developments, I decide to take a break and relocate over to Australia. I am now back in London ready to commit to continuing my career on a full time basis.
